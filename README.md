# Food_online_Django_Project
This project is about creating an online platform for food vendors and customers where we can create a marketplace for vendors to display their restaurants and what they can offer and customers can access the nearby restaurants to order food. Both customer and vendor will have the option to register however for vendors it would be mandatory.Admin will have the rights to approve the vendors 
to display their restaurant and services.
This will have four apps
1. Accounts
2. Customers
3. Food_Online
4. Marketplace
